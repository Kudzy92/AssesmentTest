# Section C Resistor Network
This project is a Java Console Application to that can be used to calacuate electrical circuit resistance on either series or parallel circuit.

## Functionalities:

1. Resistance calculation:

The program  will allows the user to select the circuit type i.e Series or Parallel circuit.
The program will take the resistors values as string then calculate the total resistance.

2. Displaying Useful Information:

The program will display the question and the workings

3. The complexitity of the project

The format of list of resistor values that the the program can input.
The solution to this problem the program will only accept you resistor values seperated by a comma 

## How to run the program

1. #### `Open the program with the IDE that can excute java code. Make sure JDK is installed on your machine`
1. #### `Run the testcase by opening the test classes then select the run button `
